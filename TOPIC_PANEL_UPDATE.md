# Topic-Panel Assignment Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Topic Creation Flow
- **Removed hardcoded panel ID**: No more `DEFAULT_PANEL_ID = 'default-panel'`
- **Added panel selection**: Users now select which panel to assign topics to
- **Panel filtering**: Only shows panels where the user is an admin or expert
- **Validation**: Prevents topic creation if user isn't part of any panels

### 2. Updated Components

#### `/src/routes/topics/new/+page.svelte`
- Fetches available panels on mount
- Filters panels to show only those where user has access
- Shows loading state while fetching panels
- Displays message if user has no panels

#### `/src/lib/components/topics/TopicForm.svelte`
- Added panel selector dropdown using shadcn-svelte Select component
- Accepts `panels` prop and `selectedPanelId` binding
- Shows panel selector at the top of the manual entry form
- Maintains selected panel through form submission

#### `/src/routes/topics/+page.svelte`
- Loads all panels on mount to display panel names
- Shows panel name with each topic in the list
- Uses Users icon to indicate panel association

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Clear indication of which panel a topic belongs to
- Can't create topics without being part of a panel
- Panel selection is required and intuitive
- Visual feedback throughout the process

## Usage Flow

1. **Create a Panel** (if needed)
   - Navigate to `/panels/create`
   - Enter panel details
   - Panel creator becomes admin automatically

2. **Create a Topic**
   - Navigate to `/topics/new`
   - Select target panel from dropdown
   - Use AI extraction or manual entry
   - Topic is created with proper panel association

3. **View Topics**
   - Topics list shows panel name for each topic
   - Only panel experts can provide feedback
   - Panel admins can manage rounds

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Topic Reassignment**: Add ability to move topics between panels
2. **Multi-Panel Topics**: Allow topics to span multiple panels
3. **Panel-based Filtering**: Filter topics list by panel
4. **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple topics to panels at once
